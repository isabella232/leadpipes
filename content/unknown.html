<h1>
Bummer. It's not clear what kind of pipe you have
</h1>
<p>
 Your pipe could be made of <a href="#plastic">plastic</a>, <a href="#copper">copper</a>, <a href="#steel">galvanized steel</a> or <a href="#lead">lead</a>.
</p>

<p>
To find out what kind of service line you have, call your water utility or landlord. Ask: “What is the private service line bringing water into my house made of?” You can also call a plumber and ask them to come take a look.
</p>

<p>
And if you find out it is made of lead, here’s what you can do:
</p>
<p>
If you want to get a sense of how bad the problem might be, try requesting a test from your water utility. But remember, lead release is sporadic, and one good test doesn’t mean you’re in the clear.</p>
<p>
Consider replacing your pipes. Call a local plumber to get an estimate. Your water utility might also have recommendations.
</p>
<p>
If that’s not an option, think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package). And if it’s been a few hours since you last used a tap in your house, it’s a good idea to let the water run for five minutes before you use it, to flush out any water that’s been sitting in the pipes.
