 Your pipe could be made of plastic, copper, galvanized steel or lead. If you want to know, consider calling up a plumber and asking them to come take a look.

 for lead removal (it should say &ldquo;NSF/ANSI Standard 53&rdquo; on the package). And every time your water sits for more than a few hours, let the water run for five minutes before using it &ndash; that helps flush out the lead.
