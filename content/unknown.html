 Bummer. It's not clear what kind of pipe you have.
</h1>
<p>
 Your pipe could be made of <a href="#plastic">plastic</a>, <a href="#copper">copper</a>, <a href="#steel">galvanized steel</a> or <a href="#lead">lead</a>.
</p>

<p>
 Call up your water utility or landlord. Ask them: &ldquo;What is the private service line bringing water into my house made of?&rdquo; You can also call a plumber and ask them to come take a look.
</p>

<p>
 And if you find out it is made of lead, here&rsquo;s what you can do:
</p>
<p>
 If you want to get a sense of how bad the problem might be, request a test from your water utility. But remember, lead release is sporadic and one good test doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re in the clear.
</p>
<p>
 Consider replacing your pipes. Call a local plumber to get an estimate. Your water utility might also have recommendations.
</p>
<p>
 If that&rsquo;s not an option, think about getting a water filter

  that is certified</a>
 for lead removal (it should say &ldquo;NSF/ANSI Standard 53&rdquo; on the package). And every time your water sits for more than a few hours, let the water run for five minutes before using it &ndash; that helps flush out the lead.
