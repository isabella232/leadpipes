What to do if you have lead pipes
</h1>
<p>
Here’s what you can do:
</p>
<p>
If you want to know how lead might be affecting your water, try requesting a test from your water utility. You can order tests online, too, but they aren’t as good.
</p>
<p>
Consider replacing your pipes. Call a local plumber to get an estimate. Your water utility might also have recommendations.
</p>
<p>
If that’s not an option, think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package). And if it’s been a few hours since you last used a tap in your house, it’s a good idea to let the water run for five minutes before you use it, to flush out any water that’s been sitting in the pipes.
