<h1>Your pipes are probably made of copper</h1>

That’s great because they aren’t made of lead – congratulations! But it’s still possible that you might have lead fittings or solder somewhere in the plumbing, especially if it was installed before 1960. If you want to check whether there’s lead in your water, try requesting a test from your water utility. You could also think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package).  And you can always call up a plumber to check for lead. </p>
