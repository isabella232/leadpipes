Your pipes are made of plastic

<p>
That’s good. The effect of plastic pipes on health hasn’t been extensively studied, but it’s generally accepted that they’re a good way to go when it comes to plumbing.

There’s still a chance you could have lead fittings or solder somewhere in your plumbing. If you want to check whether there’s lead in your water, try requesting a test from your water utility. If you’re concerned, you could also think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package).And you can always call up a plumber to check for lead.
