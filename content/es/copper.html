That’s great because they aren’t made of lead – congratulations! But it’s still possible that you might have some lead fittings or solder in the plumbing in your house, especially if your plumbing was installed before 1960. If you want to check whether there’s lead in your water, request a test from your water utility. You could also think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package).</p>
