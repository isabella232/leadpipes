<p>Lead exposure, even in small amounts, may cause health problems. It is connected with behavior and learning problems in kids, and high blood pressure and kidney problems in adults.</p>

<p>Lead in water systems is one possible source of exposure, and that’s because in many homes, the pipe that connects the building's plumbing to the water system is still made of lead.</p>

<p>
We’ll help you find out whether your drinking water is at risk in a few simple steps. You won't need anything fancier than a magnet and a coin, but you will need to be at home to follow along.</p>

<p>
If you do find lead, we’ll show you what you can do.
