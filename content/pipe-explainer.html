 Service lines are like straws that carry water to your house from the main. Often, the
 <span class="text-highlight highlight-public">
  part up to the property line</span>

 <span class="text-highlight highlight-private">
  most of the service line</span>
 is considered private property -- and the homeowner&rsquo;s responsibility.

 Service lines can be pure lead. If they aren&rsquo;t made of lead, they might be soldered together with lead.
