       Service lines are like straws that carry water to your house from the main. Often, the
       <span class="text-highlight highlight-public">
        part up to the property line</span>
       is considered public, and may have been replaced by the water utility. But in a lot of cities,
       <span class="text-highlight highlight-private">
        most of the service line</span>
       is considered private property -- and the homeowner&rsquo;s responsibility.

 Service lines can be pure lead. If they aren&rsquo;t made of lead, they might be soldered together with lead.
