<h1>What's a service line?</h1>

<p>
When lead gets into tap water, it often happens right before it enters the home â€“ through what is called a service line.

           Service lines are like straws that carry water to your house from the main. Often, the
           <span class="text-highlight highlight-public">
            part up to the property line</span>
           is considered public, and may have been replaced by the water utility. But in a lot of cities,
           <span class="text-highlight highlight-private">
            most of the service line</span>
           is considered private property &ndash; and the homeowner&rsquo;s responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
         Service lines can be pure lead. If they aren&rsquo;t made of lead, they might be soldered together with lead.

  To find out what your service line is made of, you&rsquo;ll need a refrigerator magnet, and a key or a coin.
